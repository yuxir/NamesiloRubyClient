# Namesilo Ruby client

Please follow me at: https://steemit.com/@yuxi

## What is the project about?

This project is aiming to provide a Ruby client for Namesilo REST APIs. This gem can be used in Ruby/Rails application to retrieve information form Namesilo and send requests to Namesilo server, e.g. listing all domains, email forwards, url forwards, register a new domain, renew a domain etc.   

> Namesilo makes an application programming interface (API) available to all users as a convenience to customers who have additional automation requirements. The API allows access to accounts via our users' own software as opposed to needing to log in through our web interface.
